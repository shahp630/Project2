### Proposal:

  * Our project will look to analyze the historical trends of two cryptocurrencies and two equities to
make predictions on their strategy returns.  Afterwards, the returns will be used as a comparison between the two financial assets. The analysis will employ the SVC Classifier from SVM and the Logistic Regressions.
  * Our analysis will use those models and predict the cumulative returns of the two asset classes to asses which one would be more advantagous for our client to invest in. 
  * The two Cryptocurrenies we will be using will be Bitcoin and Ethereum and the two equities we will be using will be Apple & Microsoft. We wil be sourcing the data through Alpaca.
  * Some of the libraries/dependencies we will be using will be tensorflow, numpy & matplotlib.
  * One machine learning library that we are using that was not taught in class is PyTorch.

### Explanation:
 The reason we picked these 4 is because these are the 2 largest assets (by market cap) in their respective fields.


### Roles: 
 * Apple- Chuck
 * Microsoft - Stacey
 * Bitcoin - Parth
 * Ethereum - Terrell
